    <!--
        Note how I'm basically extending an existing Style

        Java equivalent:

        public class MyStyle extends ExistingStyle

        This is me calling a theme "AppTheme" and extending the DayNight theme.

        Notice also, I reference colorPrimary, and the other colors
        BUT
        There are 2 different color values, one in the Night, and the other in NotNight

        Android will know what color to choose depending on what state the app is in (Time of day)
        OR
        It will know what to choose based on my programatically telling it to be day/night mode

    <!-- Base application theme. -->
    <style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.AppCompat.DayNight">
        <!-- Customize your theme here. -->
        <item name="colorPrimary">@color/colorPrimary</item>
        <item name="colorPrimaryDark">@color/colorPrimaryDark</item>
        <item name="colorAccent">@color/colorAccent</item>
    </style>
